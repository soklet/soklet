# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately by emailing security@revetware.com.

Include the affected Soklet version, a concise description of the issue, and any reproduction steps or proof-of-concept details that can be shared safely. Please do not open a public GitHub issue for suspected vulnerabilities until we have coordinated disclosure.

You should receive an acknowledgment within 3 business days. We will work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline appropriate to the severity of the issue.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are prioritized for the latest released version of `com.soklet:soklet`. Snapshot builds are development artifacts and may change without notice.

## Scope

Soklet has zero runtime dependencies, so vulnerabilities in the released artifact are limited to first-party code. Reports against the embedded HTTP, SSE, and MCP transports — including request parsing, connection lifecycle, and resource-limit enforcement — are especially appreciated.

## MCP Deployment Security

Soklet's MCP 2026-07-28 support runs on a dedicated `McpServer` listener. It is
not mounted on the ordinary HTTP or SSE listener. The MCP listener binds to
`127.0.0.1` by default; a container or remote deployment must opt into a
reachable bind host and provide appropriate network controls. Soklet does not
terminate TLS, so expose a non-loopback listener only behind suitable TLS
termination and access controls.

Host and Origin checks are independent. Soklet validates `Host`, including its
effective port, and `McpServer.Builder.allowedHosts(...)` adds deployment-
specific hostnames or IP literals. A request without `Origin` is allowed by
default, unless `McpAbsentOriginPolicy.REQUIRE_ORIGIN` is configured. A request
with `Origin` is rejected unless the shared `CorsAuthorizer` explicitly
authorizes it; omitting an authorizer is reject-all for present origins. Do not
treat browser CORS response headers as a substitute for authentication or
network isolation.

Every MCP server requires an explicit `McpRequestAdmissionPolicy`. Production
applications should authenticate and authorize there and return stable,
bounded rate-limit and authorization partition keys in the accepted
`McpAdmissionIdentity`. `McpRequestAdmissionPolicy.acceptAllInstance()` is an
explicit anonymous policy, not a production authentication mechanism.
Client information, client capabilities, request `_meta`, and advertised
server information are self-reported or informational metadata. Never use
them as authenticated identity or as an authorization or rate-limit partition
key.

Request-wide rate limiting is optional. A tool-bearing server must configure a
fallback tool limiter; named endpoint and tool overrides replace that fallback.
The built-in token bucket is bounded but local to one JVM. Multi-instance
deployments that require fleet-wide enforcement should supply their own
thread-safe `McpRateLimiter`, backed by a distributed service, and should fail
closed when that service is unavailable.

`@McpHeader` deliberately requires a registered `Mcp-Param-*` request-header
value to agree with the corresponding property already parsed from the JSON
tool arguments. It never supplies an absent or null argument from a header.
Treat both values as untrusted application input and avoid placing secrets in
mirrored headers unless every intermediary and application log is configured
accordingly. Unregistered mirrored headers are ignored and never trusted by
default; strict request rejection is available through
`McpUnknownMirroredHeaderPolicy.REJECT_REQUESTS`. Optional name-bearing
diagnostics are disabled by default and can still disclose received header
names to application-owned logging and retention systems, although Soklet
never includes their values.

Pagination cursors are opaque, application-owned strings. Soklet enforces type
and UTF-8 byte bounds but does not mint, decode, sign, encrypt, authorize, or
make cursors portable between instances. A custom resource-list handler owns
cursor integrity, expiry, authorization binding, backing snapshot semantics,
and fleet portability. Do not put confidential data in a cursor unless the
application protects it appropriately.

The current Phase 4 implementation supports direct discovery, tools, prompts,
resources, bounded handler execution, admission, rate limiting, interception,
and the policies above. Progress, cancellation, subscription delivery,
multi-round-trip execution, protected request-state execution, trace
correlation, comprehensive MCP telemetry, and MCP simulation are Phase 5 or 6
work. Their public configuration descriptors must not be interpreted as active
security controls until the corresponding production behavior is implemented
and documented.
